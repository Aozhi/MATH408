This repository is a collection of algorithms accompanying my paper for MATH 408 in the spring of 2011 at Case Western Reserve University. To run the algorithms, you'll need:

* Python 2.7 (other 2.x versions might work, but I have only tested against 2.7)
* MATLAB and the Signal Processing Toolbox
